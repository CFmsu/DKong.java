This is build 2 of donkey kong. It focuses on creating the level, which is composed of five
long rails and a short rail as the platform for Pauline.

Additionally began setting up hitboxes for collision, but actual collision 
detection has yet to be implemented.

This build has the hitboxes visible for debugging purposes but will be removed later.
